# StockTradingFormulaHelper 0.9
First Draft 

!!! DO NOT USE THIS APP FOR ACTUAL STOCK TRADING !!!

This is a project of mine to practice making a multi functional console application in C.

The purpose of the app is to help the user make quick calculations on stock prices and percentages.

By choosing a menu item the user can enter in prices or percentages and the program will simply do
the math for them and give them the answer they're looking for.

Disclaimer about the Math: 
Though I've tested the formulas myself this app is meant for FUN there are obviously no guarentees that everything is correct.
(reach out to me on Github or Twitter if you have a suggestion)

Disclaimer about the Code: 
At one point I ran into an issue with the "scanf" function, if the user were to enter a character instead of a number
the program would enter an infinite loop. I managed to fix this by assigning a character value at the beginning at the program, 
and then making sure the loop breaks if that changes. I know that this is not perfect and the project is still being worked on.

Thanks for checking it out!
